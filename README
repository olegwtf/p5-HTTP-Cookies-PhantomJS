HTTP::Cookies::PhantomJS - read and write PhantomJS cookies file

DESCRIPTION

This is just HTTP::Cookies subclass, so it has all same methods,
but reloads load() and save() to make available reading and writing
of PhantomJS cookies file. You can easily transform (if you need)
HTTP::Cookies object to HTTP::Cookies::PhantomJS or vice versa by
reblessing (dirty way) or with code like this:

	use strict;
	use HTTP::Cookies;
	use HTTP::Cookies::PhantomJS;
	
	 my $plain_cookies = HTTP::Cookies->new;
	 # fill it with LWP or other way
	 ....
	 # transform
	 my $phantom_cookies = HTTP::Cookies::PhantomJS->new;
	 $plain_cookies->scan(sub {
		$phantom_cookies->set_cookie(@_);
	 });
